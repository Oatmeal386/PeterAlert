## What
[It's a long story.](https://twitter.com/foxgirl_IRL/status/1307092171682656259) Essentially, a weird dream of mine became reality and is now my "hello world" for GUI toolkits.

## Win32
Made using VB6, tested working on Win2K and Win10

## Classic MacOS
Made using Codewarrior 6.0, tested on MacOS 9.2

## X11
Requires a few X11 dev libraries. Tested on macOS 11 w/ XQuartz, Linux, and OpenBSD.
